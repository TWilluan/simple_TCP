DESCRIBE YOUR CODE AND DESIGN DECISIONS HERE

WEAKNESSES:
    Even though my code works, but I am afraid my connection teardown 
    section is not correct as:
        SENDER:                         RECIEVER:
            FIN            ->               ACK
            ACK            <-               FIN      

IMPLEMENTED:
    - Sliding windows
        fixed size = 3072
    - Connection setup/teardown
    - TCP segment send/recieve

DESIGN DECISIONS:
    Context_t:
        - connection state
        - initial sequence number
        - recv_seq_num
        - window_size

    Added functions:
        - create_packet():
        - send_packet();
        - wait_for_packet():
        - app_event():
        - network_event():
        - app_close_event():
